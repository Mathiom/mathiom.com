## The breakdown
I'm probably going to be the sole developer on this thing for a while, so everything needs to be as modular as possible to make pushing releases (and fixing them) as easy as possible. Other than [The Core](#the-core), things can be built as you want, as long as they are built in one go.

Each list is limited a depth of two, representing:

* The Module
    * Milestones
